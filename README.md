# single-vs-parallel-random-walk
In this notebook I tried to simulate single and parallel random walk in a complete graph. In particular, I focused my attention on showing the following relationships:
* the cover time for a single random walk to cover all nodes in the graph grows as $cnlog n$, for some constant $c > 0$.
* if $κ = κ(n) = n$, the κ-cover time for k parallel random walk in the same graph grows as $clog n$, for some constant $c > 0$.
